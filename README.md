This is the 4th project focuses on Image Dehazing as a Computer Vision deep learning problem. Image dehazing aims to remove atmospheric haze from images, improving visibility and enhancing image quality. The project will explore the use of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to tackle this task.

By implementing a CGAN-based dehazing model, this project explores how generative adversarial networks can be conditioned on input images to generate realistic and haze-free images. The importance of incorporating contextual information from the input image to produce visually pleasing dehazed results will be highlighted as well.

Potential uses:
1.	Outdoor Imaging: Enhancing visibility in outdoor photographs taken in hazy or foggy conditions.
2.	Surveillance: Improving the clarity of surveillance footage captured in challenging weather conditions.
3.	Remote Sensing: Enhancing satellite or aerial images for better analysis and interpretation.

Learning outcomes:
1.	Understanding of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) and their application in image dehazing.
2.	Proficiency in implementing CGAN-based image dehazing models using TensorFlow and Keras API.
3.	Ability to evaluate the effectiveness of dehazing models using quantitative metrics and visual inspection.

This project is prepared by Chen Yijie under the supervision of Zhou Changxin
